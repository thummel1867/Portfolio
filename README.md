## Introduction 

Welcome to my website! This website is designed to get an idea of what I'm all about. I went with a nature theme to highlight my backgound in environmental policy. It is far from complete, and when I'm actually applying to jobs, it will likely look much different, but it's a start that I'll likely build on when I'm on the job hunt.

## Navigation 

The webpage consists of the following elements: 
    1. Opening page
    2. Bottom navigation bar
    3. A menu icon
    4. A navigation page
    5. A bio page
    6. A projects page

### Opening page 

On the opening page, the user will find three things: 
    1. An h1 element that links to the navigation page - on hover, this expands to 110% default. On click, it brings the user to the navigation page
    2. The bottom navigation bar (explored below)
    3. The menu icon (explored below)

### Bottom navigation bar

The navigation bar is fixed to the bottom page. It consists of four links, which turn a custom shade of green, overline, underline and expand to 110% default size on hover. The links are: 

BIO - links bio page
Projects - links to projects page
Github - links to my personal Github
Linkedin - links to my linkedin

A media query is included on the navigation bar such that each elements takes up the entire screen width beneath 768px. 

### The Menu Icon 

A menu button sits at the top right of the screen. A media query has been added so that it disappears when the screen width drops beneath 768px, but other than that it remains throughout the entire page. 

On hover the menu expands to 110% it's default size. 

Clicking the menu button links to the navigation page, regardless of where the user is on the page. 

### The Navigation Page 

The navigation page consists of a photo and the same nav links as the bottom nav bar. On hover the links turn a custom shade of green, overline, and underline. 

### The Bio Page 

The bio page consists of a header with my name and the title of the page, a photo on the left, and text on the right. 

### The Projects Page 

The projects page also has a header with the name and the title of the page. For the moment the page just has photos with text on them, linking to articles that I've written over the past 6 months or so. Under 768px, the size of the link photos expand to fill more of the page, and stack, so that the user can scrolls through them. On hover, the photos expand to 110% their default size.

## Next steps 

I'm slowly going to improve upon this project, in particular tightening up the styling little by litte. I also need to start adding some of my coding project as I finish them up so that the site has more than just my writing.
